# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity
# to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to
# generate. (Hint: The Fibonnaci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the 
# previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

# function that returns a fibonacci sequence (list)
def fibonacci(num = int(input("How many fibonacci numbers would you like to generate? "))):
    
    i = 1

    if num == 0:
        fib = []
    elif num == 1:
        fib = [1]
    elif num == 2:
        fib = [1,1]
    elif num > 2:
        fib = [1,1]
        # num - 1 is the index of the last item of the list
        while i < (num - 1):
            fib.append(fib[i] + fib[i-1])
            i += 1
    return fib
