'''
Vertex:

- Uses a dictionary as an adjacency list to store connected vertices.
- Connected vertex names are keys and the edge weights are values.
- Has methods to add edges and return a list of connected vertices.

Graph:

- Can be initialized as a directed graph, where edges are set in one direction.
- Stores every vertex inside a dictionary
- Vertex data is the key and the vertex instance is the value.
- Has methods to add vertices, edges between vertices, and determine if a path exists between two vertices.
